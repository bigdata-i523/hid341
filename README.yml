        This paper will provide a brief overview of how Pharmaceutical companies
        use big data applications to track and analyze data for clinical trials.  This
        paper will also explore the relationship between data quality and the intergrity
        of the clinical studies.

    abstract: We live in the age of information. Data is everywhere and is increasingly becoming a major player in the way people and companies make decisions. 
    There are many data analytics companies today to help other companies make decisions based on the data they collect. 
    People consult Yelp for decision making on a restaurant, barber shops, banks to use, etc. 
    More however, the machinery we have today from the industrial age is programmed using data we have collected over the years. 
    There is a challenge though, we cannot take random information and find an application for it without first cleaning it and presenting it in a friendlier human way, so people can make sense of it and determine its applications. 
    Hence, enter the field of Data Visualizations
